# fsi
FSI tools for partinioned coupling between generic solid and fluid solvers.

For the moment, interfaces for the following solvers are implemented:
    
- Metafor --> A Nonlinear Finite Element solid solver developed at the University of Liège (http://metafor.ltas.ulg.ac.be/dokuwiki/)
- PFEM --> Particle Finite Element Method fluid solver developed at the University of Liège (http://metafor.ltas.ulg.ac.be/dokuwiki/poliflows/start)
- SU2 --> Open-source CFD code developed at Stanford University (http://su2.stanford.edu/)
- GetDP --> A free finite element software and a general environment for the treatment of discrete problems, developed at University of Liège (http://getdp.info/)

Examples of simulations available in /tests.
